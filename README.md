# Airbnb Rental Business Predictive Model

## Project Overview
This project develops a predictive model for real estate firms planning to expand into the rental business, similar to Airbnb's model. The model predicts the "perfect_rating_score" for property listings, guiding investment decisions and highlighting profitable property features.

## Business Case
The model acts as a core profit driver for firms, predicting the ROI of properties and guiding investments in high-ROI properties. It also provides insights into features that contribute to profitability, like the "host_is_superhost" predictor.

## Repository Structure
- `Code.R`: Contains all the R code used for data cleaning, preparation, modeling, and evaluation.
- `Project Report.pdf`: Comprehensive report detailing the project's methodology, findings, and conclusions.

## Models and Technologies Used
- R Programming Language
- Machine Learning Models: GLM, GBM, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.
- Libraries: `tidyverse`, `caret`, `tree`, `class`, `gbm`

## Installation
To run the R scripts, ensure you have R and the following R packages installed:
```R
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("caret")
